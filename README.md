## General info
This project involved refactoring Hoirseons landing page to create a cleaner code base, and provide a tune up to an already working page. Existing images were updated to include
accesibility, CSS was trimmed, and HTML was edited for semantic form, as well as general readability. One href link was repaired, and all were checked for function.

Project is created with:
* Visual Code 1.60.0 (Universal)
